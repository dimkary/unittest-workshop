## Description

This project is set up as a simple and fun excercise to write your own unittest, to test a triangle library!!! The goal is to use the skeleton code to add your test cases, until # 100% coverage # is achieved. Of course more tests to cover any weird edge cases are welcome.

## Instructions

## Snippets

  ```sh
  pip install fastapi[all]
